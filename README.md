## Key Features
### SQL Analysis:
1. **Retrieve all successful bookings**:
   - Query to extract records of rides with a `successful` status.

2. **Find the average ride distance for each vehicle type**:
   - SQL query to calculate the average distance grouped by vehicle type.

3. **Get the total number of cancelled rides by customers**:
   - Query to filter and count customer-initiated cancellations.

4. **List the top 5 customers who booked the highest number of rides**:
   - Query to identify and rank customers based on booking frequency.

5. **Get the number of rides cancelled by drivers due to personal and car-related issues**:
   - Query to count cancellations, filtered by specific driver-reported reasons.

6. **Find the maximum and minimum driver ratings for Prime Sedan bookings**:
   - Query to determine the rating range for the Prime Sedan vehicle type.

7. **Retrieve all rides where payment was made using UPI**:
   - Query to filter rides based on the `UPI` payment method.

8. **Find the average customer rating per vehicle type**:
   - Query to calculate average customer ratings grouped by vehicle type.

9. **Calculate the total booking value of rides completed successfully**:
   - Query to sum up the total booking value for successful rides.

10. **List all incomplete rides along with the reason**:
    - Query to extract details of incomplete rides and their respective reasons.

### Power BI Dashboards:
1. **Ride Volume Over Time**:
   - Visualize trends in the number of rides over various time periods (e.g., daily, weekly).

2. **Booking Status Breakdown**:
   - Pie chart or bar graph showing the distribution of completed, cancelled, and ongoing rides.

3. **Top 5 Vehicle Types by Ride Distance**:
   - Highlight vehicle types with the highest average ride distance.

4. **Average Customer Ratings by Vehicle Type**:
   - Bar chart comparing customer ratings for different vehicle types.

5. **Cancelled Rides Reasons**:
   - Breakdown of cancellation reasons provided by customers and drivers.

6. **Revenue by Payment Method**:
   - Visualization of revenue split across various payment methods (e.g., UPI, card, cash).

7. **Top 5 Customers by Total Booking Value**:
   - Ranking of customers based on their total spending.

8. **Ride Distance Distribution Per Day**:
   - Histogram showing daily distribution of ride distances.

9. **Driver Ratings Distribution**:
   - Graph analyzing the spread of driver ratings.

10. **Customer vs. Driver Ratings**:
    - Comparative analysis of customer and driver rating patterns.
